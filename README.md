## description
An app containing data for different css styles. Uses inquiries to execute the choice being made.


## usage 
Can be used to help modify webpages for those who want to create their own unique looking website.

## questions
    So your motivation is to I wanted to help consumers save time in styling their own webpages so they can focus more on other aspects like making sure the page runs smoothly.
    You are doing this because I felt like making this after some loose inspiration from making a portfolio. The artistic creativity I had with the portfolio made me think of what other decorations I could have done to it..
    The problem you are trying to solve is The need to set up your own css file which usually takes time especially if you lack familiarity.
    What you have learned is the different ways of positioning and coloring texts, bubbles, and columns to name a few.

Click the links to browse through the different stlyes that are displayed on the page with provided sample texts with styles of their own. The commands from css should be displayed on the top of the page.
    
  
    
## contribution
You will first have to set up styles on css. THEN in the index, you will have to create functions that are linked to each style you have set up for the gallery.
